# Sentiment Analysis Using Azure OpenA
## üìö Project Scope
 
**Title:** Sentiment Analysis Using Azure OpenAI
 
**Objectives:**
- Use Azure OpenAI GPT models to perform accurate sentiment analysis on text data.
- Leverage Azure's scalable cloud platform for efficient data processing.
- Apply advanced language models to understand context and nuances in text sentiment.
- Compare performance with other sentiment analysis techniques.
- Deliver actionable insights to stakeholders based on data sentiment.
- Demonstrate integration of Azure OpenAI services into real-world analytical apps.

## üöÄ Deliverables
- Comprehensive documentation of project scope, methodology, and tools.
- Cleaned dataset(s) suitable for sentiment analysis (optional if only using live input).
- Implementation of an AI-driven sentiment analysis tool using Azure OpenAI GPT.
- Responsive demo/prototype web application.
- Instructions for setup, configuration, and usage.
  
## üèóÔ∏è Design Description 
The system is engineered for high accuracy and usability in determining sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) from input text.  
It leverages a robust, cloud-based Azure OpenAI backend, with secure preprocessing and modular, scalable architecture. Users interact through an attractive frontend interface, sending text that is preprocessed and analyzed in real time.
 
**Key Features:**
- Secure API key and endpoint management via `.env`
- Robust web interface (Flask + HTML/CSS) for user input and result display
- Cleaned and normalized text processing
- Responsive error handling and attractive UI
  
## üîÑ Workflow
1. **User Input:** Web frontend collects and sends text to backend.
2. **Preprocessing:** Backend cleans and prepares the text.
3. **API Integration:** Text sent securely to Azure OpenAI API.
4. **Analysis:** Model returns "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral".
5. **Results:** Sentiment displayed on the frontend in real time.
